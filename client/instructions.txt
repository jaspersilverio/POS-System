Project Goal: Develop a comprehensive Point-of-Sale (POS) system with a strong emphasis on service culture and efficient project management.

Core Features:

Your POS system must include the following functionalities:

Product Management/Inventory Management: Implement features to add, edit, and remove products, along with robust tracking of your inventory levels.

Stock Monitoring: Provide real-time visibility into stock levels and implement alerts for low stock situations.

Statistics and Reports: Generate insightful reports on sales data, inventory status, and importantly, customer feedback data.

Payment Transaction with Discount: Accurately process payments and allow for the application of discounts during transactions.

Printing Receipt: Enable the system to generate and print physical transaction receipts.

User Management with Role-Based Access Control: Implement a system for managing users with different levels of access to the POS system. This is a core component of your Service Culture subject, focusing on how different user roles impact service delivery and operational efficiency. Consider roles such as:
Cashier: Limited to basic transaction processing.
Manager: Access to reports, discounts, and some inventory management.
Administrator: Full system access, including user management, configuration, and advanced reporting.

Email Receipt with Personalized Content: When sending digital receipts, include a personalized email message to enhance customer satisfaction and demonstrate excellent service. The email should include:
A professional subject line (e.g., "Your Purchase Receipt from [Business Name]")
A personalized greeting (e.g., "Dear [Customer Name],")
A clear summary of the transaction.
A polite closing.
A customizable email signature (e.g., "Sincerely, The Team at [Business Name]")

User Authentication for Security Awareness: Implement a secure user authentication system with a focus on cybersecurity awareness and workplace safety. This includes:
Strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements).
Secure storage of user credentials.
Clear messaging to users about the importance of protecting their login information.

Post-Transaction Survey Option: After a transaction is completed and a receipt (printed or digital) is issued, the system should offer a brief satisfaction survey. This could be a prompt on a customer-facing display or a link included in the digital receipt.
The survey should use a simple rating scale (e.g., 1-5 stars or a numerical scale) to gauge customer satisfaction with their service experience.

Customizable Farewell Messages: Allow administrative users to create and manage a variety of polite and friendly farewell messages. These messages should be displayed on the POS screen after the transaction and/or printed on the receipt (both physical and digital). Examples include: "Thank you for your purchase!", "Have a great day!", "We appreciate your business!".

Data Analysis and Improvement Suggestions: The data collected from the post-transaction survey must be integrated into your statistics and reports. Your system should:
Track the frequency and distribution of feedback responses.
Calculate an overall satisfaction score or trend over time.
Provide suggestions for improvement based on the feedback data.

For Frontend (React/TypeScript) use Chart.js for data visualization.
For Backend (Laravel/PHP) use PHP's Built-in Functions for data aggregation and statistical calculations.
